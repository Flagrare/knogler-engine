# Knogler Engine

**Knogler** means "bones" in Danish. This project is the barebones of a tiny engine, built as a learning exercise in C++
and Vulkan.

## About

I'm working to become a good game programmer, and this repository is part of my journey. The goal is to build a minimal,
clean engine from scratch, focusing on core concepts and best practices.

## Features

- Minimal C++ codebase
- Vulkan window setup
- Clean, modular structure
